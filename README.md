This project is my first web project. I have been taking odin projects course for about one month and I have completed the following sub courses until now
 1. Linux terminal basics - Consists of some of the basic linux terminal keys for file navigation and file manipulation.
 2. Git and Github introduction - How this two things works along side and their uses, also how to link them together using the terminal.
 3. Html basics - Some introductory part of creating a website using html, and some basic terminologies.

At this time am expecting to compile all I have learned until now and build up a simple website. Wish me luck!
