  <h5>Steps for making the dish</h5>
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare meat sauce
      <ul>
      <li>Roughly dice the onion, and mince as much garlic as you want.</li>
      <li>Once you've got the veggies prepped, film your sauce pan with olive oil.</li>
      <li>Heat the pan over medium and cook the ground beef and Italian sausage until browned.</li>
      <li>Once you've drained the extra fat, throw in the onions and garlic.</li>
      <li>Stir this around for a few minutes over medium heat until the onions become soft.</li>
      <li>Then add in a few good pinches of Italian seasoning, a pinch of basil, 
        oregano and salt, and a tablespoon or two of tomato paste.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Cook (or Don't Cook) Your Noodles
      <ul>
      <li>You'll need to fill a stock pot with water and cook those.</li>
      <li>Once they're done, rinse them with cold water using a colander and set them aside.</li>
      <li>Try to separate them a bit so they stick less later.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Prep the Cheese and Finish the Sauce
      <ul>
      <li>Grab out a couple handfuls of parmesan and mozzarella and put them in a small bowl.</li>
      <li>Place the ricotta into a large bowl, along with one egg.</li>
      <li>Mix this all together with your hands.</li>
      <li>Once you're all done with the cheese, double check the sauce and adjust the flavors as necessary.</li>
      <li>You may need to add salt, sugar or more herbs .</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Assembling
      <ul>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F / 200 degrees C.</li>
      <li>Make sure your cheeses, noodles and sauce are all within easy reach.</li> 
      <li>Now you'll put more sauce over the cheese and then noodles, more cheese, and then sauce again.</li> 
      <li>Now bake at 375 F for 40 minute make sure it's not too dark! </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Finished Product
      <ul>
      <li>Once it's done baking, pull it out and let it sit for a few minutes before cutting into it</li>  
      <li>Serve it to a bunch of hungry friends and/or family with warm garlic bread and enjoy your meal!</li>
